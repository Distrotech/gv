.SH NAME
gv\-update\-userconfig \- update ~/.gv config file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gv\-update\-userconfig
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gv\-update\-userconfig
is a simple script to update an
.B .gv
config file
to the current version of
.BR gv (1).

This is done by removing all entries known to cause problems with
the current version of gv (i.e. the one the version of this program
belongs to) and updating the version information in that file.
This resets all problematic items back to the default values.

.SH BACKGROUND
The \fI$(HOME)\fP\fB/.gv\fP file is written by gv when activating the
\fBSave\fP button in one of the configuration dialogs.

The values in there are used, if there is no display-specific
resource value (loaded from \fI$(HOME)\fP\fB/.Xresources\fP at login time
or manually \fBxrdb\fP(1)).

Sometimes older values miss things needed by the new gv to work properly.
This gv will noticy by an old (or missing) version information in this
file and refuse to start until fixed.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR gv (1),
.BR xrdb (1).
